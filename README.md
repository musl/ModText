A Garmin ConnectIQ watch face.

## What?
This watch face builds for the Fenix 5x Plus. It's my first watch face
written with their awful, invented language.

## What does it look like?

## Fields
The field contents in order from top to bottom, left to right are:
- Altitude in default units
- % of Active Minutes Goal
- Distance Traveled
- Day of Week, Date in YYYY-MM-DD Format
- Local Time in HH:MM:SS (12 or 24 hour)
- Temperature in default units
- Battery Percentage, Charging Indicator Triangle, Notification Count
- % of Steps Goal, Activity Suggestion Icon, Heart Rate in Beats per
	Minute
- Barometric Pressure in default units

## Customization
None yet.

## Background
It's a graph of modular arithmetic.

## ToDo:
If I don't get burnt out dealing with the patronizing, sparse, and
inscrutiably pragmatic way the libraries are written or the
condescending monkey metaphors, or the lack of decent I plan on adding:

- Color Theme Support
- Customizable Fields, Units, Formats, & Icons
- Weather Provider Support
- I18N
- Bluetooth Connection Indicator
